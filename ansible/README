The service can be deployed using the recipes in fs_analysis-playbook.yml, eg.
using

ansible-playbook -i <IP>, fs_analysis-playbook.yml

Ansible v. 2.9 or better is required.

The target system needs Ubuntu 20.04, it should have at least 8 GB RAM. The
exact HW parameters depend on planned workload and volume of processed data.

Once the service has been deployed, it can be accessed using http://<IP>/. The
access credentials can be looked up in the ansible-conf.yml configuration
file.

You start by "Upload file to dataset" (see the menu in the top right)
and then displaying the Dashboard. The input data should be in the format
produced by the fls or mactime tools from the Sleuthkit. It's better to
check the Fimetis log file to see the progress. The log is by default
available as /var/log/fimetis/error.log on the server.

When the data is uploaded, it is necessary to enable the clusters providing
views on the data. Click the button titled "Managed Clusters" (in the bottom
left corned), select all cluster and save the settings. The GUI will display
the whole datasets now.
