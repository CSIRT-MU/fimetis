# Filesystem Metadata Analysis
The analysis of file systems is a crucial part of investigations of security incidents. The Fimetis tool enables analysis of metadata (timestamps, ownership, etc.) collected from file systems and streamlines processing of a large volumes of such data. Using the visual controls it is straightforward to navigate through the dataset. The analysis can also benefit from a set of pre-defined clusters identifying common file structures and operations (like crontab rules, files with weak permissions, signs of compilation on the spot, etc.).
